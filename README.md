# Modular Monolith

This is a sample monolith project where the different bounding contexts (Module1 and Module 2) are independently separated in different assemblies.

It allows us to have self contained modules with their specific classes, controllers, etc, being an intermediate step before jumping on a more microservices architecture.

It could be an inspiration for small teams, startups or just prototype projects that cannot invest the time and effort setting up a fully microservices architecture and its overhead from scratch, but also not closing that door by creating a very coupled monolith system that won't allow easily to move in that direction later on.
